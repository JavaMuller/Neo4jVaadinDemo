Vaadin + Neo4j Research Project Proposal
========================================

Purpose:
	1. Investigate how the Neo4j graph database can be used optimally with Vaadin
	2. Investigate what kind of applications are best suited for the Neo4j + Vaadin combination
	
	Optionally, if there is enough time left:
	
	3. Investigate the scalability of Neo4j + Vaadin applications

Deliverables:
	1. An example application that demonstrates how to use Neo4j + Vaadin
	2. A template project that can be used as a foundation for other Neo4j + Vaadin applications
	3. A wiki-article that describes the architecture of the application and summarizes the pros
	   and cons of using Neo4j + Vaadin
	   
	Optionally, if there is enough time left:
	
	4. A wiki-article that describes how to scale up Neo4j + Vaadin applications

Schedule:
    Initial rough estimate (without scalability testing):
    
     1 d	Introduction to Neo4j
     1 d	Specification of sample application
     2 d	Design and implementation of sample application
     2 d	Design and implementation of template project
     4 d	Wiki article
